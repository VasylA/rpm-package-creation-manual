	<p>The <strong>Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA)</strong> is an electronic amplifier with gain that can be controlled through certain parameters. The PGA is connected directly to the ADC and has various Modes, Gain and Input options.</p>

	<h4>Parameters</h4><hr>

	<h3>Power on signal:</h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">Turns PGA on or off, given ADC is off. Note that if ADC is powered-on, PGA is always forced on, even if Power down is applied here.</p>

	<h3>Gain:</h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">There are seven gain values to choose from, x0.25, x0.5, x1, x2, x4, x8 an x16. Available gain settings are different for different operating modes as below:</p>

<p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>Single-ended</strong>: x0.25, x0.5, x1, x2, x4, x8;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>Differential</strong>: x1, x2, x4, x8, x16;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>Pseudo-differential</strong>: x1, x2, x4;</p><br />
</p>

	<h3>PGA mode:</h3>

<p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>Single-ended</strong>: gain is applied to IN+ (Channel 1 or Channel 2) with reference to GND;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>Differential</strong>: gain is applied to the difference between IN+ (Channel 1 only) and IN- and given with an offset of 550 mV. e.g. Output is 550 mV when difference is zero. IN+ can be above or below IN-;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>Pseudo-differential</strong>: gain is applied to the difference between IN+ (Channel 1 only) and IN- with an offset of 180 mV. Output is 180 mV when difference is zero. Operating range assumes IN+ is always above IN-;</p><br />
</p>

	<p>&#8220;Force analog part&#8221; option in ADC should be enabled or ADC should be turned on for PGA to operate in <strong>Differential</strong> and <strong>Pseudo-differential</strong> modes.</p>

	<h3>Channel selector:</h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">Available in Single-ended mode only, the channel selector is a digital input where HIGH selects IN+ Channel1 and LOW selects IN+ Channel 2.</p>

<p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>VDD</strong>: enables only IN+ Channel 1;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>PIN16</strong>: is an external selector input to choose between IN+ Channel1 and IN+ Channel 2;</p><br />
</p>

	<h3>IN+ Channel 1:</h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">Analog Input to the PGA IN+ Channel 1 available from two external sources.</p>

<p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>PIN8 Analog input</strong>;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>PIN9 Analog input</strong>;</p><br />
</p>

	<h3>IN+ Channel 2:</h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">Analog Input to the PGA IN+ Channel 2 available from two external sources.</p>

<p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>PIN8 Analog input</strong>;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>PIN9 Analog input</strong>;</p><br />
</p>

	<h3>IN- Channel:</h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">Analog Input to the PGA IN- Channel available from an internal or external source.</p>

<p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>PIN9 Analog input</strong>;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>DAC0 out Analog input</strong>;</p><br />
</p>

	<h3>Analog output:</h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">Enable/Disable PIN7 as analog output of the PGA. For proper functionality, PIN7 must be configured as Analog input/output.</p>
