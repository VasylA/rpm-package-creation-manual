	<p>The Power Detect (PWR DET) is used to monitor the state of the internal charge pump regulator. The block only has one output (OUT) but a few configuration settings must be set in order for the pin to be enabled.</p>

	<h4>Description</h4><hr>

	<p>In order to use the PWR DET output, the project settings must be correctly configured. In the general project settings (Project Settings button -&gt; General tab) <strong>Power supply control mode</strong> must be set to Charge pump automatic ON/OFF and <strong>Disable power auto detector function for charge pump</strong> set to Enabled.</p>

	<p>Once the settings have been properly configured, the PWR DET output is HIGH when VDD&lt;2.7V and LOW when VDD&gt;2.7V.</p>
