	<h4>Description</h4><hr>

	<p>The SLG46140 provides a small, low power component for commonly used mixed-signal functions. The user creates their circuit design by programming the one time Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) to configure the interconnect logic, the I/O Pins and the macro cells of the SLG46140. This highly versatile device allows a wide variety of mixed-signal functions to be designed within a very small, low power single integrated circuit. The macro cells in the device include the following:</p>

<p>
	<p class = "li1">• Two Analog Comparators (ACMP);</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Voltage References (Vref) with Chopper stabilized amplifier;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Eight combinatorial Look Up Tables (LUTs);</p>
	<p class = "li2">- Four 2-bit LUTs;</p>
	<p class = "li2">- Four 3-bit LUTs;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Eight combination function macrocell;</p>
	<p class = "li2">- Two selectable FF/Latch or 2-bit LUTs;</p>
	<p class = "li2">- Two selectable FF/Latch or 3-bit LUTs;</p>
	<p class = "li2">- One selectable 16-Stage / 3- Output Pipe Delay or 3-bit LUT;</p>
	<p class = "li2">- One selectable Counter/Delay or 3-bit LUT;</p>
	<p class = "li2">- One selectable Counter/Delay or 4-bit LUT;</p>
	<p class = "li2">- One selectable Pattern Generator or 4-bit LUT;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Three Digital Comparators/Pulse Width Modulators (DCMPs/PWMs) w/ selectable deadband;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Four Counter / Delay generators (CNT/DLY);</p>
	<p class = "li2">- Two 14-bit delay/counters;</p>
	<p class = "li2">- Two 8-bit delays/counters;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• One Pipe Delays – 16 stage/3 output (Part of combination function macrocell);</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Programmable Delay w/ Edge Detection;</p>
