	<h4>Description</h4><hr>

	<p>The SLG46621 provides a small, low power component for commonly used mixed-signal functions. The user creates their circuit design by programming the one time Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) to configure the interconnect logic, the I/O Pins and the macro cells of the SLG46621. This highly versatile device allows a wide variety of mixed-signal functions to be designed within a very small, low power single integrated circuit. The macro cells in the device include the following (please see Block Diagram below):</p>

<p>
	<p class = "li1">• Six Analog Comparators (ACMP);</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Voltage References (Vref) with Chopper stabilized amplifier;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Twenty five combinatorial Look Up Tables (LUTs);</p>
	<p class = "li2">- Eight 2-bit LUTs;</p>
	<p class = "li2">- Sixteen 3-bit LUTs;</p>
	<p class = "li2">- One 4-bit LUT;</p>
	<p class = "li2">- One combination function macrocell;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• One selectable Pattern Generator (PGEN) or 4-bit LUT;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Ten Counter / Delay generators (CNT/DLY);</p>
	<p class = "li2">- Four 14-bit Delay/Counters;</p>
	<p class = "li2">- Six 8-bit Delays/Counters;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Two Pipe Delays – 16 stage/3 output (Part of combination function macrocell);</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Two Programmable Delays;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Additional logic functions &#8211; 2 Inverters;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• RC Oscillator (RC OSC);</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Low Frequency Oscillator (LF OSC);</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Ring Oscillator (Ring OSC);</p><br />
