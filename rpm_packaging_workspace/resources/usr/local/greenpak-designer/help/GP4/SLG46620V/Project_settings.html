	<h3>Lock status: </h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">This option allows the locking of NVM code in the programmed chip, preventing a subsequent read of the chip NVM sequence. </p>

	<h3>Pattern ID:</h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">An 8-bit code programmed onto the chip that can be used to identify the NVM code programmed onto the chip. </p>

	<h3>Power Supply Control mode:</h3>

<p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>Regulator always ON and Charge Pump is automatically ON/OFF (use for dynamic 1.71V &lt; VDD &lt; 5.5V)</strong>: Charge pump uses auto power detector function. Auto power detector function auto turns on charge pump when VDD is detected &lt;2.7V. When VDD is &gt;2.7V, the charge pump will be off.</p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>Regulator always ON and Charge Pump always OFF (use for dynamic VDD &gt; 2.7V)</strong>: Charge pump auto power detector function is off therefore Charge pump is always off. at VDD &lt; 2.7V, Analog components may not work as expected.</p><br />
</p>

	<h3>GPIO quick charge:</h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">During the POR sequence, a 2kΩ resistor is connected in parallel to any configured pull-up/down resistors. The 10K, 100K and 1M GPIO Pull-Up/Pull-Down resistors are not enabled until POR so the quick-charge option can help inputs get to the right voltage faster, especially if there is significant capacitance.</p>
