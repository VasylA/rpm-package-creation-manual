	<p>The <strong>Input/Output Pins (I/O PINS)</strong> are for receiving external signals and sending signals out. These general purpose I/Os (GPIOs), can be configured as Analog and Digital inputs and outputs with the exception of PIN2 which can only serve as a digital input or external reset. PINs 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, and 12 can be used as a 3-state Output or Input and Output in the same design. </p>

	<h4>Parameters</h4><hr>

	<h3>Mode:</h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">Different mode selections per pin can have different restrictions on input/output types. </p>

<p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>Digital input with Schmitt Trigger</strong>: configures the PIN to have hysteresis which rejects fast and spurious signal transitions;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>Digital input without Schmitt Trigger</strong>;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>Low voltage digital In</strong>: the voltage threshold which determines HIGH from LOW is lower than in regular Digital input mode. Use Low voltage digital Input if a desired function is to sense low voltage logic levels (for example 1.8V input signals if the chip VDD is 3.3V or 5V);</p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>Analog In</strong></p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>1x push pull</strong></p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>2x push pull</strong></p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>1x open drain</strong></p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>Analog In and Open Drain out</strong></p><br />
</p>

	<h3>Resistor:</h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">Available for both Input and Output. All ports are in Hi-Z state until chip is powered up. In case of PIN 2, the resistors are fixed to a pull-down configuration only. In case of all other I/O PINs, the internal resistors can be configured as either pull-ups or pull- downs.</p>

<p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>Pull down resistor</strong>: Default low;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>Pull up resistor</strong>: Default high;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>Floating</strong>: no resistor;</p><br />
</p>

	<h3>Resistor value:</h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">If a Pull up or Pull down resistor was chosen for the Resistor parameter, there are three selectable resistor values.</p>

<p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>50k strongest pull up/down</strong>;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>100k medium pull up/down</strong>;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>300k weakest pull up/down</strong>;</p><br />
</p>

	<h3>Initial state:</h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">At power on reset (POR), the initial state of each PIN can be configured. Those configurations are either GND, VDD, floating or following the input.</p>
