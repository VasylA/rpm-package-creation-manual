	<p>The GreenPAK2 SLG46400 / SLG46400 Rev B is Silego&#8217;s second generation GreenPAK product and is a one-time programmable Mixed signal array and comes in a small 2.5mm x 2.5mm TDFN-12 package.</p>

	<p>The GreenPAK2 operates at a 1.8V to 5V voltage range and provides a small, low power component for commonly used mixed-signal functions.</p>

	<p>The user creates their circuit design by programming the one time Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) to configure interconnect logic, I/O pins and macro cells of the SLG46400. This highly versatile device allows a wide variety of Mixed-signal functions to be designed within a very small, low power single integrated circuit.</p>
