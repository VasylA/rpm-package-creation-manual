	<h3>Lock status: </h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">This option allows the locking of NVM code in the programmed chip, preventing a subsequent read of the chip NVM sequence. </p>

	<h3>Pattern ID:</h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">An 8-bit code programmed onto the chip that can be used to identify the NVM code programmed onto the chip. </p>

	<h3>Power Supply Control mode:</h3>

<p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>VDD directly to analog blocks (use for VDD &lt; 1.9V)</strong>: Bypass regulator for VDD &lt; 1.9V, supply power directly from VDD.</p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>Regulator and Charge Pump automatically ON/OFF (use for dynamic 1.71V &lt; VDD &lt; 5.5V)</strong>: Charge pump and Regulator uses auto power detector function. Auto power detector function auto turns on charge pump when VDD is detected &lt;2.7V. When VDD is &gt;2.7V, the charge pump will be off.</p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>Regulator auto ON/OFF and Charge Pump always OFF (use for dynamic 3.0V &lt; VDD &lt; 5.5V)</strong>: Charge pump auto power detector function is off therefore Charge pump is always off. When VDD &lt; 3.0V, Analog components may not work as expected.</p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>Regulator auto ON/OFF and Charge Pump always ON (use for dynamic 1.71 &lt; VDD &lt; 3.0V)</strong>: Charge pump is always on.</p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>None</strong>: Some devices are all-digital devices; there are no analog components. Therefore, this parameter does not apply.</p><br />
</p>

	<h3>GPIO quick charge:</h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">During the POR sequence, a 2kΩ resistor is connected in parallel to any configured pull-up/down resistors. The 10K, 100K and 1M GPIO Pull-Up/Pull-Down resistors are not enabled until POR so the quick-charge option can help inputs get to the right voltage faster, especially if there is significant capacitance.</p>
