	<p>The SLG46118 includes a P-FET Power Switch designed for load switching applications. The P-FET Power Switch contains a 19mΩ RDSON, 2 A P-ch MOSFET with fixed slew rate control. The P-FET Power Switch can be controlled internally via the ON digital input of the P-FET Power Switch component in GreenPAK Designer, allowing the user to generate integrated mixed-signal control circuits, or externally via PWR_SW_ON (PIN 11).</p>

	<p>The P-FET Power Switch need not be used in the same voltage domain as VDD. However, when VIN is not tied to VDD, using a large pull-down resistor on PWR_SW_ON (PIN 11) is recommended to prevent current from flowing through the P-FET Power Switch while the device is not powered.</p>

	<p>The slew rate on the FET switch is user selectable by external capacitor connected to the CAP pin.</p>

	<p>The SLG46118 has two forms of current limiting (Standard Current Limiting Mode and Short Circuit Current Limiting Mode). These modes are automatically switched depending on voltage inputs.</p>

	<p>Inputs: VIN0 and VIN1 must be connected to the same inputs. VOUT0 and VOUT1 are 1A channels each. They must be connected together to draw up to 2A.</p>

	<h4>Parameters</h4><hr>

	<h3>Control mode: </h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">Control the FET with an external control PWR_SR_ON (PIN11) or use an internal ON connection</p>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">When configured to be controlled internally, PWR_SW_ON (PIN 11) is configured as Push-Pull output.<br />
When configured for external control, PWR_SW_ON (PIN 11) is configured as Low voltage digital input (LVDI) and can be used as an input to other integrated components.</p>
