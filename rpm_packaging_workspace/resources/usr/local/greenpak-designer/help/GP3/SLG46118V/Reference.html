	<p>The GreenPAK3 SLG46118 is Silego&#8217;s third generation GreenPAK product and is a one-time programmable Mixed signal array coming in a small 1.6 mm x 1.6mm STQFN-12 package.</p>

	<p>The GreenPAK operates at a 1.8V to 5V voltage range and provides a small, low power component for commonly used Mixed-signal functions.</p>

	<p>Users create their circuit design by programming Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) to configure interconnect logic, I/O PINs and macrocells of the SLG46118. This highly versatile device allows a wide variety of Mixed-signal functions to be designed within a single very small, low power integrated circuit.</p>
