	<p>There are two types of Additional Logic Functions: Inverters and Filters. </p>

	<p>The <strong>Inverter (INV)</strong> is a simple inverter. It takes a digital input and outputs the opposite binary value.</p>

	<p>The <strong>Deglitch filters (FILTER)</strong> operate as short Low-Pass filters. Set a filter output as non-inverted or inverted in the properties menu. The pulse width filtered out is respective of the delay time (listed in properties) or less.</p>
