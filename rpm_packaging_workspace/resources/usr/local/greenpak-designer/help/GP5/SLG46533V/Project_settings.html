	<h4>NVM Options</h4><hr>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">The <strong>Non-Volatile Memory (NVM)</strong> holds all configuration bits of the PAK device. The NVM is broken into four banks where the first three can be Locked, preventing subsequent reads or writes of the chip&#8217;s NVM sequence. </p>

	<h3>Lock status: </h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">The memory space is divided into four banks, each of which has 512bits (64bytes). There is the option that allows the user to define rules for reading and writing bits in each of these banks via I2C. <br />
Read protection: if the system provides any read commands to the addresses in locked banks, the device will respond with ‘FFH’ in data field.<br />
Write protection: if the system provides any write commands to the addresses in locked banks, the device will acknowledge these commands, but will not do internal writes to the register space.</p>

<p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>Unlocked</strong>: no read or write protection;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>Locked for read bits &lt;1535:0&gt;</strong>: Bank 0/1/2 is locked for read;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>Locked for write bits &lt;1535:0&gt;</strong>: Bank 0/1/2 is locked for write;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>Locked for write all bits</strong>: Bank 0/1/2/3 is locked for write;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>Locked for read and write bits &lt;1535:0&gt;</strong>: Bank 0/1/2 is locked for read and write;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>Locked for read bits &lt;1535:0&gt; and write of all bits</strong>: Bank 0/1/2 is locked for read and Bank 0/1/2/3 is locked for write;</p><br />
</p>

	<h3>Pattern ID: </h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">An 16-bit NVM location used to differentiate the NVM code programmed onto the chip. The Pattern ID is the only information accessible from a NVM locked chip.</p>

	<h4>General Project options:</h4><hr>

	<p>General Power, Analog and Quick Charge Options can be configured here.</p>

	<h3>Force bandgap on: </h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">The bandgap must be on for analog components to function correctly. Typically, the bandgap is powered on and off dynamically based on usage in the system to save power; however, the bandgap can be forced on all the time to improve turn on response time of analog components.</p>

	<h3>Bandgap output delay time: </h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">There is a selectable delay that is added after the bandgap voltage has become valid. This gives analog blocks time to start up before valid data is acquired.<br />
<p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>Auto-Delay</strong>: Default</p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>100us</strong></p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>550us</strong>: select if charge pump is used. See Parameter &#8216;Power Supply Control mode&#8217; below.</p><br />
</p></p>

	<h3>Power Supply Control:</h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">Analog components require a VDD greater than 2.7. For VDDs less than 2.7V, an internal Charge Pump is used to boost the voltage. Let the GreenPAK dynamically turn on and off the charge pump, or keep it always on, always off, or source directly from VDD without the charge pump.</p>

	<h3>GPIO quick charge:</h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">During the POR sequence, a 2kΩ resistor is connected in parallel to any configured pull-up/down resistors. The 10K, 100K and 1M GPIO Pull-Up/Pull-Down resistors are not enabled until POR so the quick-charge option can help inputs get to the right voltage faster, especially if there is significant capacitance.</p>
