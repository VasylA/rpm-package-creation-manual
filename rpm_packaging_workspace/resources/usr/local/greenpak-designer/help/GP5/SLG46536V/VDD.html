	<p>VDD pin represents the main power supply and is an output only block. It is digital high when VDD crosses the power up detect threshold and is valid before POR. </p>

	<p>Connections to VDD are by default set as labeled connections, and creating a new wire from VDD will create a new labeled connection. These connections can be changed to wired connections by right-clicking the desired wire and selecting the option “Convert to wired connection”.</p>

	<p>Any pin left unconnected in the Designer is by default connected to GND.</p>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">Set of operating conditions. These settings are for the user only. They do not affect the NVM bits but affect the VDD range limit the chip will work at. See datasheet for electrical characteristics.<br />
These settings can be set by changing specs values (&#8220;Project Info&#8221; dialog).</p>
