	<p>The Power On Reset (POR) macrocell will produce a logic HIGH signal as an output when the device power supply (VDD) rises to approximately 1.4 V and device completely starts up. All outputs are in Hi-Z state and chip starts loading data from NVM. The reset signal is released for internal blocks and they start to initialize according to the following sequence:</p>

	<p><strong>General POR Sequence</strong><br />

	<p><strong>Internal Block States during POR Sequence</strong><br />

	<p>The POR signal going HIGH indicates the mentioned powerup sequence is complete.</p>

	<p>NOTE: DLY cells will pass their inputs through during the startup sequence without delaying the signal per the configuration, so a LUT added in front of the input of a DLY that ANDs the DLY input with POR will guarantee the input signal will not appear until the chip has fully powered up and will enforce delays. </p>
