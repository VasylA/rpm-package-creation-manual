	<p>A <strong>D Flip Flop (DFF)</strong> captures the value of the D-input at the edge of the clock and holds the value as memory. A <strong>latch (LATCH)</strong> passes the D-input when the Clk is LOW and holds the value as memory when the Clk is HIGH. All connections are user-selected through the connection matrix and these macrocells have initial state parameters, nRESET, nSET option as well as output polarity parameters</p>

	<h4>Activation</h4><hr>

	<p>DFFs without an nRESET input are always activated.<br />
DFFs with an nRESET input must be activated through the nRESET pin. Connect nRESET to a non-gnd signal.</p>

	<h4>Parameters</h4><hr>

	<h3>Mode:</h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">The DFF/LATCH macrocells have two modes. As a DFF or as a LATCH.</p>

<p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>DFF</strong>: edge triggered D Flip-Flop;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>LATCH</strong>: level triggered latch;</p><br />
</p>

	<h3>nSET/nRESET:</h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">Some DFFs have the option to SET/RESET. This function is active low. If no SET/RESET is desired, set this connection to VDD or a constant HIGH source.</p>

<p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>nRESET</strong>: if HIGH then the DFF/LATCH is in normal operation. If LOW then Q is reset to 0;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• <strong>nSET</strong>: if HIGH then the DFF/LATCH is in normal operation. If LOW then Q is set to 1;</p><br />
</p>

	<h3>Initial polarity:</h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">Select the power on condition before any D-input is available. This is only effective until the first CLK input.</p>

	<h3>Q output polarity:</h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">Choose to invert or not invert output Q; nQ will be the inverse of Q.</p>
