	<h4>Description</h4><hr>

	<p>The SLG46580 is a small, low power component for commonly used to integrate mixed-signal functions under control of an asynchronous state machine. The user creates their circuit design by programming the one time Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) to configure the interconnect logic, the I/O Pins and the macro cells of the SLG46580. This highly versatile device allows a wide variety of functions and control logic to be designed within a very small, low power single integrated circuit. The macro cells in the device include the following:</p>
