	<p>The SLG46580V comes with four low dropout regulators each rated at 150 mA. Each LDO regulator has 3 modes which are: HP MODE is the standard active mode; LP MODE is a low power mode performance compromised mode; and finally BYPASS MODE in which the LDO regulator ceases to regulate and the Regulator MOSFET is turned on as a power switch passing the voltage applied to VIN directly to VOUT.</p>

	<p>The LDO regulators are paired together with LDO1 and LDO2 sharing the same VIN called LDO_Vin0, likewise LDO3 and LDO4 share the same VIN called LDO_Vin1.</p>

	<h4>Activation</h4><hr>

	<p>Connect the &#8216;ENABLE&#8217; input to a logic high signal.</p>

	<h4>Parameters</h4><hr>

	<h3>Mode:</h3>

	<p>The MOSFET gate is regulated by a comparator. Chose which input to use as the Vref.</p>

	<h3>VOUT0 voltage: </h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">In increments of 100mV. 0.9V, 1.0V &#8230; 4.20, 4.30, 4.35V.</p>

	<h3>VOUT1 voltage:</h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">In increments of 100mV. 0.9V, 1.0V &#8230; 4.20, 4.30, 4.35V.</p>

	<h3>Start-up ramping slope:</h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">A slow start-up ramp when the LDO is enabled. Either 10V/ms or 20V/ms.</p>

	<h3>Discharge resistor:</h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">If the LDO is disabled, a 300 pull down can be asserted on LDO&#8217;s Vout to discharge. </p>

	<h3>Overcurrent &amp; short-circuit detection:</h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">Enable Over-current and Short-Circuit-Current protection.</p>

	<h4>Connections</h4><hr>

	<h3>UVLO:</h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">This parameter is shared with the corresponding ACMP properties. If Enabled, the ACMP output will be routed to the UVLO input of the LDO.</p>
