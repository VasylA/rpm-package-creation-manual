	<p>A <strong>Look-Up Table (LUT)</strong> is an array that stores an input/output relationship for combinatorial logic. The outputs of the LUTs can be configured to any user defined function, including the following standard digital logic devices (AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR, XNOR, Inverter, Buffer).</p>

	<h4>Examples</h4><hr>

	<h3>Logic cells:</h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">LUT can be configured with standard logics (AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, NXOR, Inverter, Buffer) or defined by a user for specific functions.</p>

	<h3>Edge detectors:</h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">As propagation through the LUT takes some time, an edge detector can be created using two LUTs. To create an Edge detector, use 2 LUTs. Connect the input to both a LUT for delay and a LUT to compare, while connecting the output of the delay LUT to the input of the compare LUT. The compare LUT should be configured to output HIGH whenever the 2 inputs are different.</p>

	<h3>Latches:</h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">If the output of the LUT is connected to its input and it is configured in a proper way the output can be latched when the defined signal appears on one of the remaining LUT inputs.</p>

	<h3>Multiplexers:</h3>

	<p style="margin-left:2em;">Use one or more inputs to control which of the signals propagates to the output.</p>
