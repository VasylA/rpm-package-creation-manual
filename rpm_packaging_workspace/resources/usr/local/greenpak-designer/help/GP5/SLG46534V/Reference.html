	<h4>Description</h4><hr>

	<p>The SLG46534 provides a small, low power component for commonly used mixed-signal functions. The user creates their circuit<br />
design by programming the one time Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) to configure the interconnect logic, the I/O Pins and the macro<br />
cells of the SLG46534. This highly versatile device allows a wide variety of mixed-signal functions to be designed within a very<br />
small, low power single integrated circuit. The macro cells in the device include the following:<br />
<p>
	<p class = "li1">• Three Analog Comparators (ACMP);</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Seventeen Combination Function Macrocells:</p>
	<p class = "li2">- Three Selectable DFF/Latch or 2-bit LUTs;</p>
	<p class = "li2">- One Selectable Continuous DFF/Latch or 3-bit LUT;</p>
	<p class = "li2">- Four Selectable DFF/Latch or 3-bit LUTs;</p>
	<p class = "li2">- One Selectable Pipe Delay or 3-bit LUT;</p>
	<p class = "li2">- One Selectable Programmable Pattern Generator or 2-bit LUT;</p>
	<p class = "li2">- Five 8-bit delays/counters or 3-bit LUTs;</p>
	<p class = "li2">- Two 16-bit delays/counters or 4-bit LUTs;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Asynchronous State Machine:</p>
	<p class = "li2">- Eight States;</p>
	<p class = "li2">- Flexible input logic from state transitions;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Serial Communications:</p>
	<p class = "li2">- I2C Protocol compliant;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Pipe Delay – 16 stage/3 output (Part of Combination Function Macrocell);</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Programmable Delay;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Additional Logic Functions – 2 Deglitch Filters with Edge Detectors;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Two Oscillators (OSC):</p>
	<p class = "li2">- Configurable 25 kHz/2 MHz;</p>
	<p class = "li2">- 25MHz RC Oscillator;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Crystal Oscillator;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Eight Byte RAM + OTP User Memory:</p>
	<p class = "li2">- RAM Memory space that is readable and writeable via I2C;</p>
	<p class = "li2">- User defined initial values transferred from OTP;</p><br />
