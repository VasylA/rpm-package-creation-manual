	<p>The user creates their circuit design by programming the one time Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) to configure interconnect logic, I/O Pins and macro cells of the SLG46200. This highly versatile device allows a wide variety of mixed-signal functions to be designed within a very small, low power single integrated circuit. </p>

	<p>The macro cells in the device include the following: <br />
<p>
	<p class = "li1">• Pulse Width Modulator (PWM);</p>
	<p class = "li1">• 8-Bit Successive Approximation Register Analog to Digital Converter (SAR ADC);</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Serial to Parallel Converter (S2P);</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Power-On Reset device (POR);</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Voltage Reference (VREF);</p>
	<p class = "li1">• RC Oscillator (RC OSC);</p>
	<p class = "li1">• 3 Counter/Delay Generators (CNT/DLY);</p>
	<p class = "li1">• 3 D Flip-Flop/Latches (DFF);</p>
	<p class = "li1">• 2 Digital Comparators (DCMP);</p>
	<p class = "li1">• 2 Analog Comparators (ACMP);</p>
	<p class = "li1">• 7 Combinatorial Lookup Tables (LUT);</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Configurable I/O Pins (Open drain, Push-pull, Schmitt trigger input, Low voltage digital input and Analog I/O);</p><br />
</p></p>

	<p>The specific functions that can be designed using the SLG46200 include: <br />
<p>
	<p class = "li1">• Power-On-Reset Generators;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Signal Delay Elements;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• One-Shot Detection;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Voltage Level Detectors;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Voltage Level-Shift Circuits;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Battery Charge Controller;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• LED Lighting Control;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Fan Controller;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Optical Encoder;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Level Shifters;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Hall Effect Driver;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• Signal De-Glitches;</p>
	<p class = "li1">• and many other functions;</p><br />
</p></p>

	<p>The PWM and ADC macro cells also support more complex control circuits such fan speed controllers, stepper motor controllers and interface to a wide variety of sensor devices. Traditionally these devices were designed from combinations of low complexity logic and discrete devices requiring costly board space while having complex testing strategies. Silego’s SLG46200 allows the functionality of these circuits to be fully tested before being mounted onto a PCB – greatly simplifying the system design and testing procedures.</p>
